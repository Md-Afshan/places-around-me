    <u>About School:-</u>
    Miss. E. M. Bain, a missionary of the Church of Scotland mission, founded the C.S.I. Bain Matriculation & Higher Secondary School in the year 1929 mainly 
    for boys of the Nursery and Primary age. By the sacrificial and dedicated life and sustained efforts of her successor Miss. Jessie Moses, the school was 
    upgraded as a Matriculation school in the year 1963 and then as a Higher Secondary school in 1978. The rapid growth of the school and the credit of it goes
    to the dynamic personality â€“ Miss Jessie Moses. The school is recognized by the Education Department of the Tamil Nadu Government and is under the 
    management of Higher Education of the Church of South India. Our school motto is â€œFounded on Rockâ€ and we believe that the Rock represents Jesus Christ.
    The motto expresses the objective of this institution. It suggests that the institution is built on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ and it is a Christian
    Institution. Religious and moral formation is still an important aspect of the education here. Its purpose is to help the students to reflect on the great 
    question of life and to understand the meaning of being human. The school is located Ormess road, Kilpauk, Chennai-10.
